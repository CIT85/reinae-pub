        <h2>Why I Am Taking This Course</h2>
        <p>
          I decided to take this course because I am passionate about technology and web development. I believe learning to build functional and visually appealing websites will help me contribute meaningfully to the tech industry. Additionally, I am currently exploring various career paths within tech, and this course offers me the opportunity to test if web development is a field I want to pursue further.

        <h2>What I Think of Using ChatGPT for Research</h2>
        <p>
            Using ChatGPT for research has been incredibly useful. It allows me to quickly gather information, clarify complex concepts, and explore new topics in a more interactive way. I appreciate how ChatGPT explains ideas in simpler terms, making difficult material much easier to understand. Additionally, ChatGPT tailors its responses based on the user's level of understanding, providing more or less detail as needed, which makes it a highly adaptable tool for learning. It also makes research much faster and easier, and I really enjoy using it.
